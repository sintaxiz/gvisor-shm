# The runsc-race target is a race-compatible BUILD target. This must be built
# via: bazel build --features=race :runsc-race
#
# This is neccessary because the race feature must apply to all dependencies
# due a bug in gazelle file selection.  The pure attribute must be off because
# the race detector requires linking with non-Go components, although we still
# require a static binary.
#
# Note that in the future this might be convertible to a compatible target by
# using the pure and static attributes within a select function, but select is
# not currently compatible with string attributes [1].
